#XNet

### What is it?
* This program is designed to be a user-friendly yet advanced P2P filesharing network capable of bootstrapping itself and dynamically sharing peers.

### How does it work?
* (Coming soon)

### Is it safe?
* As an open source project, all source code is available on this repository. If you feel unsafe, build your own copy. It doesn't use Maven at the time, so you'll have to download Eclipse (or an IDE of your choice), import the project, and build a JAR.

### What is this project licensed under?
* See the bottom of the page.

### Special Thanks
